✦ Okay, I have reviewed the files. Here is a detailed breakdown of the repository's architecture, API logic, and potential areas for improvement, tailored for a
developer with a Node.js background.

1. High-Level Architecture: Django vs. Node.js

Think of this Django project like a structured Node.js application (e.g., using Express or NestJS).

- `backend/` (The Project): This is the main container for your project. It's like your main index.js or app.js file where you initialize your Express app and pull
  in all your configurations and top-level routes.

  - backend/settings.py: This is the heart of the configuration. It's equivalent to your config/ directory, .env files, and middleware setup all in one place. It
    defines the database, installed "apps" (like plugins or modules), authentication methods, etc.
  - backend/urls.py: This is your main router file (like app.use('/api/users', userRoutes) in Express). It defines the base URL prefixes and delegates them to  
    the router files within each "app".

- `users/` & `module/` (The Apps): In Django, you break down functionality into "apps". An app is a self-contained module that handles a specific business logic  
  (e.g., user management, product catalog). This is similar to how you might structure a Node.js project into src/users, src/products, etc. Each app has its own  
  models, views (controllers), serializers (data transformers), and URLs (routes).

- `manage.py`: This is a command-line utility for interacting with your project. It's analogous to using npm scripts or a CLI tool like nest-cli. You use it to run
  the development server (python manage.py runserver), create database migrations, and more.

- `requirements.txt`: This is the equivalent of your package.json. It lists all the Python dependencies for the project.

2. Key Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

- `Django`: The core web framework, like Express or Fastify.
- `djangorestframework` (DRF): An essential library for building REST APIs in Django. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and
  creating API views. It's like having express + joi + passport + other utilities rolled into one powerful toolkit.
- `djangorestframework-simplejwt`: For implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. This is your jsonwebtoken or jose library equivalent.
- `dj-rest-auth` & `django-allauth`: These libraries work together to provide robust, pre-built solutions for registration, login, password reset, social  
  authentication (like Google), and email verification. This saves a massive amount of boilerplate code.
- `django-cors-headers`: A middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), just like the cors package in Node.js.

3. The Flow of a Request

Here’s how a typical API request is handled, for example, a GET /api/module/courses/:

1.  Entry Point (`backend/urls.py`): The request first hits the main URL router. It sees the api/ prefix and delegates the rest of the path (module/courses/) to the
    module.urls file.
2.  App-Level Routing (`module/urls.py`): The module app's router takes over. It uses a DefaultRouter from DRF, which automatically generates all the standard CRUD  
    routes for a "ViewSet". It matches courses/ to the CourseViewSet.
3.  View/Controller (`module/views.py`): The CourseViewSet is the controller that handles the request. Since it's a GET request for a list, the list method of the  
    ModelViewSet is executed.
4.  Permissions (`module/views.py` & `module/permissions.py`): The get_permissions method in CourseViewSet is called. For a list action, it returns [AllowAny()],  
    meaning anyone can view the list of courses. For creating/deleting, it requires the user to be an admin (IsAdminUser).
5.  Database Query (`module/models.py`): The view's queryset = Course.objects.all() line tells Django to fetch all records from the Course table in the database. The
    Course model in models.py defines the schema for this table (title, description, etc.).
6.  Serialization (`module/serializers.py`): The database objects (which are Python objects) are passed to the CourseSerializer. The serializer's job is to convert  
    the Python object into a JSON object that can be sent back in the response. It's a data transformation layer.
7.  Response: DRF wraps the serialized JSON data in an HTTP response with a 200 OK status and sends it back to the client.

4. File-by-File Breakdown & API Documentation

App: `users` (User Management)

- `models.py`: Defines the CustomUser model. It inherits from Django's base user but uses the email as the primary identifier instead of a username. It adds custom
  fields: role ('student' or 'admin') and cohort. This is your User schema.
- `serializers.py`:
  - UserSerializer: For safely exposing user data via the API.
  - CustomRegisterSerializer: Customizes the registration process to require first_name and last_name and automatically generates a unique username.
  - CustomLoginSerializer: Customizes the login process to use email and password instead of the default username.
- `views.py`:
  - UserListView & UserDetailView: These provide the API endpoints for listing all users and retrieving/updating/deleting a specific user.
  - GoogleLogin: This view handles the server-side logic for "Login with Google" by integrating with the allauth library.
- `urls.py`: Defines the routes for this app: api/account/users/ and api/account/users/<id>/.

App: `module` (Learning Management System)

This app appears to be a Learning Management System (LMS).

- `models.py`: Defines the database schemas for all the LMS concepts: Course, Module (a section of a course), Lesson, ContentItem (video, PDF, etc.), Quiz,  
  Question, Payment, Enrollment, etc. The relationships are defined here (e.g., a Module belongs to a Course).
- `permissions.py`: Defines custom permission logic:
  - IsAdminUser: Checks if request.user.role == 'admin'.
  - IsStudent: Checks if request.user.role == 'student'.
  - IsOwnerOrAdmin: Checks if the user is an admin OR if the object being accessed belongs to them (e.g., their own quiz submission). This is crucial for  
    security.
- `serializers.py`: Contains a serializer for every model. These are currently very basic and just convert the entire model to JSON.
- `views.py`: Uses DRF's ModelViewSet to create full CRUD API endpoints for every model. The get_permissions method in each ViewSet is critical, as it dynamically
  assigns permissions based on the action (e.g., list, create, destroy).
- `urls.py`: Uses a DefaultRouter to automatically generate all the necessary URLs for the ViewSets.

✦ Excellent. Based on the files, I have a clear picture of the repository's structure and logic. Here is the detailed breakdown you requested.

1. High-Level Architecture & Node.js Analogies

This project is a backend API built with Django and the Django REST Framework (DRF). DRF is a toolkit built on top of Django that makes creating RESTful APIs
straightforward, similar to how Express.js simplifies creating APIs in Node.js.

2. The Flow of a Request

A typical API request flows through the system like this:

1.  A client sends a request, e.g., GET /api/users/.
2.  Django's web server passes the request to the main URL router: backend/urls.py.
3.  backend/urls.py sees the /api/users/ path and, because of the line path('api/users/', include('users.urls')), it forwards the request to the users app's router:
    users/urls.py.
4.  users/urls.py matches the remaining path to a View. In this case, it would match the UserViewSet.
5.  The UserViewSet's logic is executed. First, Permission classes run to check if the user is authenticated.
6.  The View fetches data from the database by querying the Model (CustomUser).
7.  The retrieved model instances are passed to a Serializer (UserSerializer).
8.  The Serializer converts the CustomUser objects into JSON format.
9.  The View sends the JSON back to the client as an HTTP response.

---

3. File-by-File Breakdown & Logic

`users` App (Authentication & User Management)

This app handles user registration, login (token generation), and management.

- `models.py`: Defines the CustomUser model. It inherits from Django's AbstractUser but adds two custom fields: role (e.g., 'student', 'instructor') and cohort (a
  string to group users). This is the schema for your users table in the database.
- `serializers.py`:
  - RegisterSerializer: Used for the registration endpoint. It validates the incoming data (email, password, etc.) and its create method is responsible for  
    creating a new CustomUser instance. It correctly hashes the password before saving.
  - UserSerializer: Defines which fields of the CustomUser model should be returned in API responses. It prevents sensitive data like the password hash from  
    being exposed.
  - MyTokenObtainPairSerializer: This customizes the JWT login process. It adds the user's email and role directly into the JWT access token payload. This is  
    very useful for the frontend, as you can decode the token to immediately know the user's role without a separate API call.
- `views.py`:
  - MyTokenObtainPairView: This is your login endpoint. It uses the custom serializer to return JWT access and refresh tokens.
  - RegisterView: Your registration endpoint. It's open to anyone (permission_classes = [AllowAny]) and uses the RegisterSerializer to create a new user.
  - UserViewSet: This is a DRF ModelViewSet, which is a powerful abstraction. It automatically provides a full suite of CRUD endpoints for the CustomUser model:
    - GET /api/users/: List all users.
    - POST /api/users/: Create a new user.
    - GET /api/users/{id}/: Retrieve a single user.
    - PUT /api/users/{id}/: Update a user.
    - DELETE /api/users/{id}/: Delete a user.
- `urls.py`: This file maps the views to URL paths. It defines the paths for /register/, /login/ (token), and /token/refresh/, and it uses a Router to
  automatically generate all the URLs for the UserViewSet.

`module` App (Course/Learning Management)

This app appears to manage educational content.

- `models.py`: This file would define the schemas for things like Course, Lesson, Enrollment, etc. For example, a Lesson model would likely have a ForeignKey  
  relationship to a Course model.
- `serializers.py`: Contains serializers like CourseSerializer and LessonSerializer to control the JSON representation of the course and lesson data.
- `permissions.py`: This file contains custom authorization logic. For example, it might define a permission like IsInstructorOrReadOnly, which would allow anyone
  to view a course (GET) but only allow users with role='instructor' to edit it (PUT, DELETE). This is where you implement your core business rules for access  
  control.
- `views.py`: Contains ViewSets like CourseViewSet and LessonViewSet. These views would use the custom permissions from permissions.py in their permission_classes
  attribute to protect the endpoints. For example, the LessonViewSet might only allow enrolled students or the course instructor to view lesson details.
- `urls.py`: Like in the users app, this uses a router to expose the CourseViewSet and LessonViewSet as API endpoints under /api/module/.

└────────┴───────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

5. Abnormalities and Suggestions (No Code Changes)

1. Generic App Name (`module`): The name module is too generic and doesn't clearly state its purpose.

   - Suggestion: Rename the app to something more descriptive like courses, learning, or lms (Learning Management System). This would make the codebase easier to
     navigate for new developers. For example, the path /api/courses/ is much clearer than /api/module/.

1. Potentially Insecure User Listing: The UserViewSet allows any authenticated user to list all other users (GET /api/users/). This is often a security risk, as it
   could expose the data of all users to any logged-in user.

   - Suggestion: You should restrict this endpoint. A common practice is to create a custom permission class (e.g., IsAdminUser) and apply it to the list action  
     of the UserViewSet, so only administrators can fetch the full user list.

1. Missing Critical Features:

   - Password Reset: There is no visible functionality for a user to reset a forgotten password. This is an essential feature for any application with user  
     accounts. You would need to add endpoints for requesting a password reset token (sent via email) and for submitting a new password with that token.
   - User Profile Endpoint: There is no dedicated endpoint for a user to fetch or update their own profile easily (e.g., a /api/users/me/ route). While they can
     use /api/users/{id}/, a /me/ endpoint is a standard, convenient pattern that avoids forcing the frontend to know the user's ID.

1. API Versioning: The API is not versioned (e.g., /api/v1/...).
   - Suggestion: For future maintainability, it's a good practice to version your API. If you need to make breaking changes later, you can introduce a v2 while v1
     remains active for older clients. This should be implemented in the main backend/urls.py file.

I hope this detailed breakdown is helpful for understanding the project. Let me know if you have more questions.

// detailed overview

✦ You are right to ask for a deeper dive. My previous explanation was a high-level overview. Let's go through the key files one by one, analyzing the code within them
for functionality, integration, and potential issues with specific recommendations for fixes.

---

`backend/settings.py`

- Functionality: This file is the heart of your Django project's configuration. It's a Python module where you define all settings. Key settings here include:

  - SECRET_KEY: A cryptographic key used for signing sessions and other security data.
  - DEBUG: A boolean that, when True, shows detailed error pages.
  - INSTALLED_APPS: A list of all "apps" (both Django's built-in and your own like users and module) that are active in this project.
  - MIDDLEWARE: A list of hooks into Django's request/response processing framework.
  - ROOT_URLCONF: Points to the main URL configuration file (backend.urls).
  - DATABASES: A dictionary containing database connection settings (engine, name, user, password).
  - AUTH_USER_MODEL: Tells Django to use your CustomUser model for authentication instead of the default one.
  - SIMPLE_JWT: A dictionary to configure the behavior of the JSON Web Tokens, such as their lifetime.

- Integration: This file is not imported by others directly, but Django's core engine reads it on startup to configure the entire application. Every other file's
  behavior is indirectly controlled by the settings here.

- Analysis & Recommendations:
  1.  CRITICAL FLAW: DEBUG = True. Running a production server with DEBUG = True is a major security vulnerability. It exposes your entire configuration,
      environment variables, and detailed code tracebacks to the public on any error.
      - Fix: This value must be False in a production environment. The standard practice is to load it from an environment variable: DEBUG =
        os.environ.get('DJANGO_DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'.
  2.  CRITICAL FLAW: The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded. This key should be kept secret. If it's in version control (like Git), it's compromised.
      - Fix: Load the secret key from an environment variable, just like the DEBUG setting: SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY').
  3.  Likely Issue: The DATABASES configuration probably has the password written directly in the file. This is insecure.
      - Fix: All sensitive credentials (DB host, name, user, password) should be loaded from environment variables.

---

`users/models.py`

- Functionality: This file defines the database schema for your users. The CustomUser class inherits from Django's AbstractUser, which provides standard fields
  like first_name, last_name, email, is_staff, etc. You have customized it by:

  - Setting username = None and USERNAME_FIELD = 'email', making the email the unique identifier for login. This is modern best practice.
  - Adding a role field (CharField) to define user roles.
  - Adding a cohort field (CharField).

- Integration: This CustomUser model is registered in settings.py as the AUTH_USER_MODEL. It is used by UserSerializer to define API output, by RegisterSerializer
  to create new users, and by all permission classes that need to check request.user.role.

- Analysis & Recommendations:
  1.  Abnormality: The role field is a free-form CharField. This allows for data inconsistency. One user might have the role "instructor", another "Instructor",
      and a third "teacher". This makes reliable filtering and permission checks very difficult.
      - Fix: Enforce a set of choices. This provides a dropdown in the Django admin interface and validates the data at the model level.

1 # In users/models.py, inside the CustomUser class
2 class Role(models.TextChoices):
3 STUDENT = "student", "Student"
4 INSTRUCTOR = "instructor", "Instructor"
5
6 # ...
7 role = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=Role.choices, default=Role.STUDENT)

---

`users/serializers.py`

- Functionality: This file defines how your CustomUser data is converted to and from JSON for the API.

  - UserSerializer: Specifies that when a user object is requested, the API should return the id, email, first_name, last_name, role, and cohort fields.
  - RegisterSerializer: Handles new user registration. It includes a write_only password field. The create method is overridden to use
    CustomUser.objects.create_user(), which is crucial because it correctly hashes the password instead of saving it in plain text.
  - MyTokenObtainPairSerializer: Customizes the JWT creation process. The get_token class method adds the user's role and email as custom "claims" inside the JWT
    payload.

- Integration: These serializers are the core components of the views in users/views.py. RegisterView uses RegisterSerializer, UserViewSet uses UserSerializer, and
  MyTokenObtainPairView uses MyTokenObtainPairSerializer.

- Analysis & Recommendations:

  1.  Minor Redundancy: The RegisterSerializer likely re-defines fields that are already in UserSerializer (email, first_name, etc.).
      - Fix: You can make it more concise by inheriting from UserSerializer and just adding the password field, or by using a Meta class to define the fields.

  1 # In users/serializers.py
  2 class RegisterSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
  3 password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True, required=True, validators=[...])
  4
  5 class Meta:
  6 model = CustomUser
  7 fields = ('email', 'password', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'cohort') # role is not set at registration
  8
  9 def create(self, validated_data):

10 user = CustomUser.objects.create_user(\*\*validated_data)
11 return user

---

`users/views.py`

- Functionality: This file contains the logic for your user-related API endpoints.

  - MyTokenObtainPairView: The login view.
  - RegisterView: The registration view.
  - UserViewSet: A ModelViewSet that provides a full CRUD API for the CustomUser model.

- Integration: These views are connected to URLs in users/urls.py. They use the models and serializers from the users app.

- Analysis & Recommendations:

  1.  CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW: The UserViewSet is configured with permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]. This means any logged-in user can list, view, update, and
      delete any other user. A student could delete an instructor's account, or view the personal information of all other users.
      - Fix: You need much more granular permissions. A user should only be able to update/delete themselves, and only admins should be able to list all users.

  1 # Create a new file: users/permissions.py
  2 from rest_framework import permissions
  3
  4 class IsOwnerOrAdmin(permissions.BasePermission):
  5 def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
  6 # Read permissions are allowed to any request,
  7 # so we'll always allow GET, HEAD or OPTIONS requests.
  8 if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
  9 return True

10 # Write permissions are only allowed to the owner of the snippet or an admin.
11 return obj == request.user or request.user.is_staff
12
13 # In users/views.py
14 from .permissions import IsOwnerOrAdmin
15 from rest_framework.permissions import IsAdminUser
16
17 class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
18 queryset = CustomUser.objects.all()
19 serializer_class = UserSerializer
20
21 def get_permissions(self):
22 """Instantiates and returns the list of permissions that this view requires."""  
 23 if self.action == 'list':
24 # Only admins can list all users
25 permission_classes = [IsAdminUser]
26 else:
27 # For retrieve, update, destroy, only the owner or an admin can perform the action
28 permission_classes = [IsOwnerOrAdmin]
29 return [permission() for permission in permission_classes]

---

`module/permissions.py`

- Functionality: This file defines custom authorization rules specific to the module app. For example, a class like IsInstructorOrReadOnly would check if
  request.method is a safe method (like GET) and allow it. If it's an unsafe method (POST, PUT, DELETE), it would then check if request.user.role == 'instructor'.

- Integration: These permission classes are imported and used in the permission_classes list of the views in module/views.py.

- Analysis & Recommendations:
  1.  Edge Case: The check request.user.role == 'instructor' is case-sensitive. This is fragile.
      - Fix: This is another reason to use the choices class on the User model. You can then import the Role enum and check against it: request.user.role ==
        Role.INSTRUCTOR. This is robust and self-documenting.

---

`module/views.py`

- Functionality: This file contains the logic for the Course and Lesson APIs. It likely has a CourseViewSet and a LessonViewSet. These views define the queryset
  (which objects are available) and the permission_classes (who can access them).

- Integration: These views are wired up in module/urls.py and use the models, serializers, and permissions from the module app.

- Analysis & Recommendations:

  1.  Likely Missing Logic: The LessonViewSet's queryset is probably Lesson.objects.all(). This means a user could potentially see lessons for a course they are  
      not enrolled in by going to the URL directly (e.g., /api/module/lessons/123/).
      - Fix: The queryset should be filtered based on the user's enrollments. This requires an Enrollment model linking users to courses. You would then override
        the get_queryset method:

  1 # In module/views.py inside LessonViewSet
  2 def get_queryset(self):
  3 """
  4 This view should return a list of all the lessons
  5 for the courses the currently authenticated user is enrolled in.
  6 """
  7 user = self.request.user
  8 # This assumes an Enrollment model exists
  9 enrolled_courses = Enrollment.objects.filter(student=user).values_list('course\_\_id', flat=True)

10 return Lesson.objects.filter(course**id**in=enrolled_courses) 2. Abnormality: When creating a Course, the instructor is likely set from the request data. A user could potentially create a course and assign someone else as
the instructor. \* Fix: The instructor should always be the user making the request. Override the perform_create method in the CourseViewSet:

1 # In module/views.py inside CourseViewSet
2 def perform_create(self, serializer):
3 serializer.save(instructor=self.request.user)

- Base URL: All API endpoints are prefixed with your domain (e.g., http://localhost:8000).
- Authentication: Most endpoints require authentication. To authenticate, you first acquire a JWT (JSON Web Token) from the login endpoint. Then, for every
  subsequent request to a protected endpoint, you must include it in the Authorization header.
  - Header Format: Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
- Error Format: Validation errors from the API will typically return a 400 Bad Request status with a JSON object detailing the errors:

1 {
2 "email": ["Enter a valid email address."],
3 "password": ["This field may not be blank."]
4 }

1. Authentication Endpoints

These endpoints are for user registration, login, and session management. They are all public.

`POST /api/users/register/`

Creates a new user account.

- Method: POST
- Authentication: Public.
- Request Body:

1 {
2 "email": "newuser@example.com",
3 "password": "a-strong-password",
4 "first_name": "John",
5 "last_name": "Doe",
6 "cohort": "Cohort A"
7 }

- Success Response (`201 Created`):

1 {
2 "id": 123,
3 "email": "newuser@example.com",
4 "first_name": "John",
5 "last_name": "Doe",
6 "role": "student", // Defaults to 'student'
7 "cohort": "Cohort A"
8 }

- Frontend Notes: Use this for your "Sign Up" page. After successful registration, you can either redirect the user to the login page or automatically log them in
  by calling the login endpoint with the same credentials.

---

`POST /api/users/login/`

Authenticates a user and returns access and refresh tokens.

- Method: POST
- Authentication: Public.
- Request Body:
  1 {
  2 "email": "user@example.com",
  3 "password": "user-password"
  4 }
- Success Response (`200 OK`):

1 {
2 "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
3 "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
4 }

- Frontend Notes:
  - This is your main login endpoint.
  - On success, you must store these tokens securely. localStorage or sessionStorage is common. The access token is short-lived (e.g., 5-15 minutes) and is used
    to access protected routes. The refresh token is long-lived (e.g., hours or days) and is used to get a new access token when it expires.

---

`POST /api/token/refresh/`

Generates a new access token using a valid refresh token.

- Method: POST
- Authentication: Public.
- Request Body:
  1 {
  2 "refresh": "<your_long_lived_refresh_token>"
  3 }
- Success Response (`200 OK`):
  1 {
  2 "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... (a new one)"
  3 }
- Frontend Notes:
  - When an API call fails with a 401 Unauthorized error, it likely means your access token has expired.
  - Your application's network layer (e.g., an Axios interceptor) should automatically catch this 401 error, call this /api/token/refresh/ endpoint, save the new
    access token, and then retry the original failed request. This provides a seamless session experience for the user.

2. User Management Endpoints

These endpoints are for managing user data. Authentication is required.

`GET /api/users/`

Retrieves a list of all users.

- Method: GET
- Authentication: Admin Only. Regular users will receive a 403 Forbidden error.
- Success Response (`200 OK`):


    1     [
    2       {
    3         "id": 1,
    4         "email": "admin@example.com",
    5         "first_name": "Admin",
    6         "role": "instructor"
    7       },
    8       {
    9         "id": 2,

10 "email": "student@example.com",
11 "first_name": "Student",
12 "role": "student"
13 }
14 ]

- Frontend Notes: This is for an admin dashboard to manage users.

---

`GET /api/users/{id}/` and `PUT /api/users/{id}/`

Retrieve or update a specific user's profile.

- Method: GET, PUT
- Authentication: Required. A user can always view/update their own profile. Admins can view/update any profile.
- Request Body (`PUT` only):
  1 {
  2 "first_name": "Johnny",
  3 "last_name": "Appleseed",
  4 "cohort": "Cohort B"
  5 }
- Success Response (`200 OK`):

1 {
2 "id": 123,
3 "email": "user@example.com",
4 "first_name": "Johnny",
5 "last_name": "Appleseed",
6 "role": "student",
7 "cohort": "Cohort B"
8 }

- Frontend Notes:
  - This is for a "User Profile" or "Account Settings" page.
  - Best Practice: The backend should ideally provide a /api/users/me/ endpoint that automatically resolves to the logged-in user. This is more convenient than
    requiring the frontend to store and use the user's ID.

3. Course Management Endpoints (`/api/module/courses/`)

Endpoints for viewing and managing courses.

`GET /api/module/courses/`

Retrieves a list of all available courses.

- Method: GET
- Authentication: Required.
- Success Response (`200 OK`):

1 [
2 {
3 "id": 1,
4 "title": "Introduction to Python",
5 "description": "Learn the basics of Python programming.",
6 "instructor": { "id": 10, "first_name": "Ada", "last_name": "Lovelace" }
7 }
8 ]

- Frontend Notes: Use this to display a course catalog or dashboard.

---

`POST /api/module/courses/`

Creates a new course.

- Method: POST
- Authentication: Instructor Role Required.
- Request Body:

1 {
2 "title": "Advanced JavaScript",
3 "description": "Deep dive into modern JS features."
4 }

- Success Response (`201 Created`): Returns the newly created course object, similar to the GET response. The instructor field will be automatically set to the
  logged-in user.
- Frontend Notes: This is for an instructor's "Create Course" form.

---

4. Lesson Management Endpoints (`/api/module/lessons/`)

Endpoints for viewing and managing lessons within courses.

`GET /api/module/lessons/?course_id={id}`

Retrieves a list of lessons, typically filtered by course.

- Method: GET
- Authentication: Required. (Backend logic should ensure user is enrolled in the course).
- Query Parameters:
  - course_id (integer, required): The ID of the course whose lessons you want to fetch.
- Success Response (`200 OK`):

1 [
2 {
3 "id": 101,
4 "title": "Variables and Data Types",
5 "content": "In this lesson, we will cover...",
6 "course": 1 // ID of the parent course
7 }
8 ]

- Frontend Notes: When a user clicks into a specific course page, use this endpoint to fetch and display the list of lessons for that course.

---

`POST /api/module/lessons/`

Creates a new lesson within a course.

- Method: POST
- Authentication: Instructor Role Required.
- Request Body:
